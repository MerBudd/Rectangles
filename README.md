*Rectangles* is a platformer game with very basic mechanics. It isn't the kind of thing that'll entertain you for **weeks**, but it does sometimes offer really hard challenges, and is fun to play for a couple minutes when you're bored!

We'd really appreciate it if you could support this project by starring this repo. Your bug reports and pull requests also help out a ton! Thanks!

<summary>Quick Note</summary>
  The game isn't actually mine, I just playtest and stuff. The actual game is made by https://github.com/CRAB19.
  I own this repo only because GitHub has some sort of weird bug on Crab's device :D 
  Also the "Rectangles" repo on Crab's profile is the one where he got an error on. You can ignore it, this is the main repo for now.
